The best view of the city can be had from the top of the Tour Pey-Berland, a Gothic tower located right next to the Cathedral, and one not-to-be-missed sight is Le Miroir d’Eau near Place de la Bourse, a row of mini-fountains turning the square into a giant water mirror.

      "         Chernobyl isn’t an easy place to visit. Despite being only a two-hour drive north of Kiev and near the border with Belarus, access to Chernobyl is strictly controlled and is limited to workers and tour operators. The city is infamous for being the site of the world’s first major nuclear reactor accident. On 26 April 1986, Chernobyl reactor 4 suffered a critical power surge and sent radioactive material into the atmosphere. The surrounding area was contaminated, including the cities of Chernobyl and Pripyat. This area is called the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The entire area was evacuated within days of the explosion. Most tour groups visit Chernobyl and Pripyat (the city built for the power plant workers). Chernobyl is still inhabited by clean-up workers and offers two hotels and a restaurant, bar, and small shop. The tours are offered of Chernobyl and the abandoned city of Pripyat. The cities showcase Soviet architecture and the memorials built in the zone. It is possible to walk the streets of cities, but due to safety concerns, entrance into abandoned buildings is not allowed. The abandoned cities stand as a stark reminder of how nature will reclaim the land when humans leave.\n",
